# Showcase of how I write an Angular app

## Why this app?

To give potential clients (I'm a freelance front-end developer) an idea of how I write (Angular) code and unit tests.

## What does this app do?

It's quite simple actually. You can (fake) sign up, log in and view a personalised dashboard page (only visible when you are logged in).

It however contains enough functionality to include directives, http requests, observables, guards, (accessible) form validity and state management.

## Useful information

- Run `npm start` to run the app locally on `http://localhost:4200`
- Run `npm test` to run unit tests
- Run `npm run lint` to analyse code
- This app in written in Angular 15
